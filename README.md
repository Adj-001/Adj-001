- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aditya Jaiswal from Lucknow, India. 
- 🤺  A tech geek & web enthusiast who is always learning. Currently, mastering Web Development.
- 💻 Had launched a startUp in past "A Hyper Local Ecommerce" named Echokart. At that time I was new to Development therefore used WordPress for it's functioning. But      after using it I got to know there's alot of limitation of using woocommerce and other wordpress plugins & themes. 
- 🐧 I always use to wonder that how these giangantic webapps from the likes of Robinhood & Zerodha to the mega ecoomerce like Amazon & Flipkart use to work and makes our     day to day life so easy. From buying the stocks of our faverote company to ordering the pizza we always die for.
- 👨‍ Passionate about technology and always eager to learn and stay up to date with the latest developments in the field.
- 💻 In my previous projects, I have worked on developing and maintaining web applications, ensuring that they are user-friendly & performant.
